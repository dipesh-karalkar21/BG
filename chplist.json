The word vā is used in the sense of ca (“and”). “Na ayaṁ bhūtvā bhavitā vā”—It does not, having come into being, again exist: this denies the second transformation called ‘post-birth existence’. Why? Because It is aja—unborn. That which is born comes into existence after birth, but that which exists by itself (svataḥ) does not come into being again. “Nityaḥ”—always of the same form: this denies growth. “Śāśvataḥ”—eternal: this denies decay. “Purāṇaḥ”—ancient: this denies transformation. Though existing from ancient times, It does not become new by any change; it is not that due to change It acquires a new form. Or, taking “na bhavitā” in its secondary sense, the idea is: it will not become more than what it already is—this denies increase. Thus, “ajo nityaḥ” is the reason for both absence of regeneration and of growth, and so the repetition is avoided. Therefore, all the six modifications described by Yāska and other Vedic scholars—birth, existence, growth, transformation, decline, and destruction—are denied. The purpose for denying these modifications is to affirm the indestructibility that is under discussion.

Therefore, I, the omniscient one, have already clearly declared in the earlier chapter this twofold pursuit aimed at liberation. I refer only to this difference in approach: for those with pure minds who have ascended to the platform of knowledge, steadfastness in Brahman was prescribed through the yoga of knowledge, such as in the verse “Restraining all the senses, one should remain absorbed in Me,” etc. For those who aspire to climb that platform by purifying their minds, the yoga of action was prescribed—such as “For a kṣatriya, there is no greater good than a righteous war.” Thus, these two are simply stages of inner purification and not ultimately distinct.\n\n",

And one who sees action in inaction—i.e., the omission of what is enjoined—as producing demerit and thus a cause of bondage, he is praised: among men who perform action, he is wise, because he possesses resolute intellect; he is a yogī, and by that action attains knowledge-yoga. He is also said to be the doer of all actions, because in that act, comparable to a body of water overflowing from all sides, all other karmic results are included. By this, the previously mentioned karma-yoga (like “action is said to be the means for one seeking to ascend yoga”) is now clearly restated. And since this section is in the form of an elaboration, there is no fault of repetition.\n\nBy this same reasoning, in the higher stage of yoga (mentioned earlier as “for one who has already attained yoga, inaction is the means”), the statement that there is no use of karma also is to be interpreted as elaborated. When even for one ascending yoga action does not cause bondage, then for one already established in yoga, how could it?\n\nAlternatively, one who, though dwelling in activity involving the body and senses, perceives inaction (natural inaction, innate non-doership) due to realization of the Self as distinct from body and senses; and one who, in renouncing actions out of sorrow due to lack of knowledge, sees that very renunciation as karma, due to its being an obstacle (a false discipline), such a person is intelligent among all humans.\n\nThe reason: although performing all actions that arise of their own accord (like eating, etc.), he remains united (yukta), established in knowledge of the Self as a non-doer, immersed in samādhi—this is the meaning.\n\nThus, it should be understood that even in the case of the knower, actions that happen naturally, like eating meat or other minor irregularities, do not lead to fault. For one ignorant, however, doing so due to attachment is indeed faulty. Therefore, the truth regarding prohibited action (vikarma) is also to be understood here.\n\n",

To dispel such doubt, it is said: due to absence of egoistic identification as the doer, it is not contradictory. That is stated in these two verses: “He who is united…” (५.८–५.९). One who is harmonized in karma-yoga and gradually becomes a knower of truth—though engaging in seeing, hearing and so on—considers, through firmly established understanding, that “I do nothing at all,” because “the senses move among the sense objects.” That is, vision, hearing, touch, smell, eating are the activities of the knowledge senses (jñānendriyas) such as eyes, ears, skin, etc. Walking is the activity of the feet; sleep belongs to the intellect; breathing belongs to prāṇa; speech to the organ of speech; elimination to the organs of excretion and generation; grasping to the hands; opening and closing the eyes belong to the tortoise-named prāṇa. These are the distinctions. Performing all such actions, yet due to absence of identification as the agent, the knower of Brahman is not tainted. Thus, the Vedānta Sūtra states: “Because of its attainment (of Brahman), there is no contact or destruction of previous or future karma, because of the scriptural declaration” (Brahma Sūtra ४.१.१३).\n\n",

The sparśās—objects like form and taste—are external sense-objects. Even when they are imagined, they enter inwardly. By abandoning such thoughts, keeping them outside (bahir eva kṛtvā), and placing the gaze at the space between the brows (bhruvor antare)—fixing it precisely at the midpoint between the eyebrows. If the eyes are completely closed, the mind merges into sleep; if fully open, it wanders outward. To avoid both these faults, the gaze is directed to the space between the brows with half-closed eyes (ardha-nimīlana). The prāṇa and apāna, moving within the nose (nāsa-antare), are the upward and downward flowing vital airs. Making them equal by restraining their upward and downward movement (nirodha), meaning holding the breath (kumbhaka). Alternatively, the prāṇa not moving outward, and the apāna not moving inward—but both remaining at the middle of the nose—are thus made equal through slow inhalation and exhalation.\n\n",

From these arises delusion (moha), a loss of discrimination, caused by dualities like heat and cold, pleasure and pain, etc. By that delusion, sarva-bhūtāni—all beings fall into saṁmohaṁ—deep confusion, identifying with notions such as “I am happy” or “I am unhappy.” As a result, due to absence of knowledge of Me, they do not come to know Me.\n\n",

For it is not possible to lift anyone out of saṁsāra without self-knowledge. Therefore, the teaching of knowledge of tattva is commenced, through a chapter on the discrimination between prakṛti and puruṣa.\n\nIn Chapter ७, two kinds of prakṛti—aparā and parā—were described. Due to the non-discrimination between these two, the conscious portion assumes the identity of the jīva, and undergoes saṁsāra. It is through these two prakṛtis that the Lord creates the world for the enjoyment of the jīva. These very two prakṛtis are meant by the words kṣetra and kṣetrajña. The Lord now begins to define them distinctly:\n\n“This”—meaning, this body, which is the abode of enjoyment—is called the field (kṣetra), because it serves as the fertile ground for the sprouting of saṁsāra. The one who knows it—who considers it as “I” and “mine”—is called the kṣetrajña, the knower of the field, just as a farmer is the enjoyer of the fruit of the field.

All other so-called knowledge is merely learnedness and is ultimately a cause of bondage.” Therefore, it is said: “That karma which does not lead to bondage is real karma; that knowledge which leads to liberation is real knowledge.

Also by the brahma-sūtras, or aphoristic statements which indicate brahman, such as “from which all beings are born” (yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante), which convey indirect definitions (taṭastha-lakṣaṇa), and others like “brahman is that which is existence, knowledge, and infinity” (satyam jñānam anantaṁ brahma), which give essential definitions (svarūpa-lakṣaṇa). These also describe it extensively.\n\nAnd further, by rational arguments: “In the beginning, O gentle one, there was only existence”; “How could the existent come from the non-existent?”; “Who would breathe, if bliss were not present in the space within the heart?”; “It is He who bestows bliss”—these and other statements are full of reasoning. Similarly, “Who would direct the function of apāna?”, “Who would cause the activity of prāṇa?”—these lines emphasize the necessity of an intelligent agent.\n\nAll these statements are characterized by clarity and consistency of beginning and conclusion (upakrama-upasaṁhāra), and by their unambiguous meaning. Thus, what has been elaborated in detail by them, and is difficult to grasp, I will now explain to you in brief—listen attentively.\n\nAlternatively, the brahma-sūtras may refer to the opening aphorism: “Now, therefore, the inquiry into Brahman.” Those very statements, which help attain brahman, are the padas (words). By them, furnished with reasons—such as “from the will,” “not from mere words,” “being of the nature of bliss,” etc.—the meaning is firmly ascertained. The rest is similar.\n\n",

The “one” refers to the internal sense, the manas (mind). The indriya-gocarās—objects of the senses—are the five tanmātras (subtle elements), which are sound, touch, form, taste, and smell.

            "sridhara": "\nWithout dispassion, there can be neither knowledge nor devotion—therefore, that is now clearly shown. Knowledge imbued with dispassion is instructed by the Lord in this Fifteenth Chapter.\n\nIn the final verse of the previous chapter, beginning with “he who serves Me with unwavering devotion,” it was said that Brahmanhood arises for the one who, by the grace of the Supreme Lord, has attained knowledge through exclusive devotion. But neither exclusive devotion nor knowledge arises in one who is not dispassionate. Therefore, wishing to teach knowledge preceded by dispassion, the Lord first describes the nature of worldly existence in metaphorical form—as a tree—in the first one and a half verses, beginning with “ūrdhva-mūlam,” etc.\n\n“ūrdhva-mūlam”—the root is above, meaning that the root is the Supreme Person, who is beyond both the perishable and imperishable.\n“adhaḥ-śākham”—those situated below Him, the upādhis of effect such as Hiraṇyagarbha, are the branches, i.e., the limbs spreading below.\nThis tree is called aśvattha—that which will not last until tomorrow—because it is perishable and unworthy of reliance, even for a day.\nIt is also said to be avyaya (imperishable), because of its unbroken continuity through the flow of transmigration. The Śruti also declares, “This eternal aśvattha tree, whose root is above and branches below…”\n\n“Chandāṁsi yasya parṇāni”—its leaves are the Vedas, because, through teaching dharma and adharma, the Vedas provide shelter (like shade) by the karmic results of action. Thus, they are likened to leaves, which are essential to the vitality of a tree.\n\nOne who knows this aśvattha tree in this manner is the knower of the Veda. The root of the tree of worldly manifestation is the Lord Nārāyaṇa; Brahmā and others are His limbs, and are like branches. This tree of worldly existence is perishable, yet also eternal in the sense of its continual flow, and it is made the object of action through the karma enjoined by the Veda. This, and nothing else, is the meaning of the Veda.\n\nTherefore, the one who knows this tree is praised as a vedavit—a knower of the Veda.\n\n",

These are the branches of that tree of worldly existence.\n\nFurther, being guṇa-pravṛddhā—nourished by the guṇas like sattva, etc.—they are made to grow, just as watering nourishes a tree.\n\n“viṣaya-pravālāḥ”—the sense objects like form, etc., are like sprouts; they are likened to tender shoots because they are closely connected with the sense-based branches.\n\nAlso, “adhaś ca,” and by implication, “ūrdhvaṁ ca”—the roots spread both downward and upward. The primary root is the Lord alone. These others are secondary roots—namely, the tendencies and impressions (vāsanās) formed by various enjoyments.\n\nTheir function is now described: “karma-anubandhīni”—those (roots) to whom karma is bound as its immediate result, those are the roots extending in the world of men.\n\nWhen, due to the exhaustion of karma, beings again reach the human realm, their latent impressions from previous enjoyment result in engagement in various actions suitable to those impressions.\n\nIt is only in this human world that karma can be performed, and not in other worlds.

Therefore, in this seventeenth chapter, the secondary (non-scriptural) types of faith are discussed as threefold.\n\nIn the final verse of the previous chapter—“He who acts according to his desires, abandoning the injunctions of scripture, does not attain perfection”—it was stated that one who follows desire by discarding scriptural ordinances is not eligible for knowledge. Now, with a desire to know whether those who, without desire but with faith, disregard the scriptures—do they have any eligibility or not?—Arjuna asks this question.\n\nBy the phrase “abandoning the injunctions of scripture and performing sacrifice,” are such persons, who know the scriptural meaning and yet transgress it, being referred to? No, because the performance of sacrifice with faith would not be consistent in that case. Faith is indeed a conviction in truth (āstikya-buddhi), and it cannot exist in those who knowingly act against scriptural knowledge.\n\nSo, who is being referred to? Only those who, without understanding the import of scripture—due to hardship, laziness, or failure to make an effort to understand—act merely on the strength of traditional customs with faith, worshipping various deities. Therefore, the meaning is this: those who, due to a mindset of difficulty or laziness, disregard the scriptural injunctions and, relying solely on the authority of custom, act with faith—what is their steadfastness (niṣṭhā)? What is their state? What is their basis?\n\nArjuna asks particularly: is it sattva? Or is it rajas? Or tamas? Their inclination toward deity-worship and the like—does it arise from sattva, rajas, or tamas?\n\nBecause faith is sāttvika in nature, yet the disregard of scripture due to hardship or laziness belongs to rajas or tamas, there is a threefold doubt. If they are grounded in sattva, then due to their sāttvika faith, they may still be eligible for the knowledge of the Self as described earlier. Otherwise, they are not—this is the intent behind the question.\n\n",

It is born of one's nature (svabhāva-jā), which arises from impressions (saṁskāras) of past actions—this is called “born of nature.” The nature (svabhāva) can be modified only by scriptural knowledge and the discriminative wisdom it generates.

However, when it resides in persons dominated by rajas and tamas, it becomes mixed with those guṇas. Hence, faith also appears as threefold. This is explained by the verse: “Faith conforms to one's sattva.”\n\nThat is, faith corresponds to the gradation of sattva in every person, whether discriminative or non-discriminative. Therefore, this worldly person is composed of faith (śraddhāmayaḥ)—he is a transformation of faith. He is shaped and altered by the three kinds of faith.\n\nThus, “as his faith is, so is he”: the one whose faith is sāttvika due to past impressions of predominating sattva, he again becomes endowed with that same sāttvika faith. Similarly, the one whose faith is rājasika or tāmasika, again becomes of that nature due to the corresponding saṁskāras.\n\nThus, among those who act merely according to worldly customs, faith exists as threefold: sāttvika, rājasika, and tāmasika. But for those endowed with discriminative wisdom generated by scripture, and who have conquered their nature, faith is only sāttvika. This is the contextual purport.\n\n",

            "sridhara": "\nNow, in response, the Blessed Lord said — “kāmyānām iti”: the renunciation (nyāsa) or abandonment of actions that are enjoined with a desire-motive — such as \"He who desires a son should perform this sacrifice,\" \"He who desires heaven should perform that sacrifice,\" and so on — is known as saṁnyāsa by the sages (kavayaḥ), i.e., the learned knowers. The implication is that even all actions in general (sarva-karmaṇām), when renounced along with their fruits, are regarded by the learned as saṁnyāsa.\n\nBut the abandonment of only the fruits of all actions — including both desire-based (kāmya) and obligatory (nitya-naimittika) duties — is declared to be tyāga by the discerning (vicakṣaṇāḥ), those who are skilled in discrimination, and not the renunciation of the actions themselves in their essential nature.\n\nNow, an objection is raised: for obligatory actions like nitya and naimittika, no fruits are prescribed in the scriptures. So how can one speak of giving up fruits that do not exist? Just as a barren woman cannot give up her child, how can there be fruit-abandonment where there is no fruit?\n\nThis is answered: although specific fruits are not explicitly mentioned in injunctions like “Let one perform the Sandhyā (twilight worship) daily,” or “Let one offer Agnihotra until the end of life,” which are seen to be daily duties, still, in order to engage a rational person toward some goal, the Vedic injunction implicitly implies a general result, as in “One should perform the Viśvajit sacrifice,” etc. Therefore, the Veda implicitly points toward a fruit even if not explicitly stated. Do not suppose that the purpose of such injunctions is solely fulfilled by the act itself, due to intense faith, as some claim — because the person would then have no motivation to act. Since it is impossible to engage someone in purposeful action without some result being in view, the fruit is understood to be implied.\n\nMoreover, even in relation to obligatory duties (nitya-karma), we do hear of results in the scriptures, such as: “All these attain the worlds of merit,” “By karma, one reaches the world of ancestors,” and “By dharma, sin is dispelled.” Therefore, it is appropriate to say, “The abandonment of the fruits of all actions is called tyāga by the wise.”\n\nNow another objection may arise: “But by merely abandoning fruits, one would still be engaged in action, even in fruitless action.” That is not a defect, because all actions, when performed for the sake of vividhiṣā — the desire to know the Self — with a clear sense of distinction between means and ends, have a legitimate application. As the Śruti says: “Desiring to know that very Self, the Brāhmaṇas perform sacrifices, give charity, practice austerity, and undertake vows.”\n\nThus, renouncing all fruits of action — which are considered binding — while performing actions with the aim of Self-knowledge (vividhiṣā), is indeed fitting.\n\nNow, vividhiṣā is the inward turning of the intellect (buddhi) caused by dispassion, born of discrimination between the permanent and the impermanent, and by renouncing identification with the body. Until such Self-realization arises, one must continue performing necessary actions that are not opposed to knowledge, for the sake of purification of the mind (sattva-śuddhi). And renunciation of the fruits alone in this way is what is known as tyāga — not the renunciation of action in its essence.\n\nAccordingly, the Śruti also says: “By performing actions here, one should desire to live a hundred years” (Īśopaniṣad २). Beyond that, all actions automatically cease of their own accord. This is stated in the text Naiṣkarmya-siddhi: “The intellect that has turned inward produces action for the sake of purification; once its purpose is fulfilled, they cease like rain-clouds in autumn.”\n\nLikewise, it is said in the Gītā itself: “The man who delights in the Self, who is satisfied in the Self, and who is content in the Self — for him there is nothing to do.”\n\nAlso, the sage Vasiṣṭha has said: “The yogī does not abandon actions; rather, he is abandoned by them — due to the destruction of their root, which is mental volition (saṅkalpa).”\n\nTherefore, only when action becomes an obstacle to steadfastness in knowledge should it be renounced. Thus, in the Bhāgavata, the Lord has said: “Let one continue performing actions until one becomes disenchanted; or, until faith in hearing My glories arises.”\n\nAlso: “Whether one is steadfast in knowledge, or dispassionate, or devoted to Me, one may abandon external marks of āśrama and wander unrestricted.”\n\nLet us not indulge in excessive elaboration — we shall proceed with the main topic.\n\n",

            "sridhara": "\nIt is to establish firmly that the meaning of the word “tyāga” (abandonment) refers only to the renunciation of fruit and not to the abandonment of action — this is done by showing the difference of opinion: “tyājyaṁ doṣavat” — some say that all action is to be abandoned as possessing fault, like violence and so on, and therefore being a cause of bondage. This is the view of certain Sāṅkhyas, referred to by the word “manīṣiṇaḥ” (the discerning).\n\nTo elaborate: “One should not injure any being” — such prohibitions imply that injury is harmful to a person. However, scriptural injunctions such as “one should offer the animal in the Agniṣomīya sacrifice” indicate that injury is supportive of the ritual. Since these refer to different topics, being governed by the rule of general versus specific (sāmānya-viśeṣa-nyāya), there is no conflict of annulment between them. And because injury and the like can occur in all actions that are dependent on material substances, they conclude that all action is to be abandoned. As it is said: “Because it is associated with impurity, decline, and excess — both seen and heard of.”\n\nIts meaning is this: the method called Jyotiṣṭoma and others is also considered a known method because it is heard from a teacher, and the śruti (Veda) reveals it. In that, the impurity is violence, and through that, there is decline or destruction. There is also gradation among the results of acts like Agnihotra and Jyotiṣṭoma, such as attainment of heaven. But superiority over others results in making all others miserable.\n\nOthers, however — namely the Mīmāṁsakas — say that sacrifice and so on should not be abandoned. The meaning is this: the injury involved in a ritual act like a sacrifice, though arising from a person, must still be performed. And even if done for another purpose, it leads to sin for that person alone. Why? Because a Vedic injunction mandates that an act must be performed for a specific purpose, and that purpose gives it the nature of being subordinate to the main aim. But a prohibition does not depend on a purpose — it only requires that the action not occur at all. Otherwise, if one commits a prohibited act due to ignorance or negligence, one would be guiltless — which is unreasonable.\n\nThus, because the two (injunction and prohibition) concern the same topic, and because a general rule is overridden by a specific one, it is concluded that the act is not faulty. Therefore, sacrifice and so on should not be abandoned, as they are obligatory.\n\nIn this way, the view that both injunction and prohibition are equally authoritative is refuted. The rule regarding general and specific texts is established to show this.\n\n",

For one who bears a body, i.e., one who identifies with the body (dehātmābhimānavān), it is not possible to renounce all actions completely.

As was stated: “traiguṇya-viṣayā vedāḥ” — “The Vedas deal with the three guṇas.” Now, “karaṇam” — the instrument is that which accomplishes the act (e.g., the senses); “karma” is that which is desired most by the agent (e.g., the outcome); “kartā” is the one who performs the act.

All four—śrī, vijaya, bhūti, and nīti—are connected to “tatra” (there). “Iti matiḥ mama”—this is my firm conviction.\n\nThus ends the commentary on the Bhagavad Gītā.\n\nSummary of the Gītā’s Meaning (Gītārtha-Saṅgrahaḥ)\n“By the grace of the Lord, one endowed with devotion to Him attains realization of the Self, and from that Self-realization comes liberation from bondage—this is the summary of the Gītā’s meaning.” ||१||\n\nIndeed, the Supreme Person, O Pārtha, is attained only by exclusive devotion:\n“Bhaktyā tv ananyayā śakya aham evaṁ-vidho ’rjuna” (१८.५५) — From such verses, it is clearly understood that single-pointed devotion to the Lord alone, accompanied by only subsidiary activity such as knowledge arising from His grace, is the true cause of liberation. That knowledge functions merely as a support to devotion.\n\n“Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam, dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ yena mām upayānti te” (१०.१०),\n“Mad-bhakta etad vijñāya mad-bhāvāyopapadyate” (१३.१९), and other such statements reveal that it is only through devotion that the Lord is to be truly known.\n\n“Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām” (१८.५४),\n“Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ” (१८.५५), etc., show the Lord is known through devotion by stating the distinction between the devotee and the Lord.\n\nOtherwise, if knowledge alone were sufficient, it would contradict the Śruti statement:\n“Evam etad vijānīyāt ātmānam eva atimṛtyum eti nānyaḥ panthā vidyate ’yanāya” — “Knowing thus, one transcends death—there is no other path to liberation.”\n\nBut since knowledge is only a subsidiary support to bhakti, there is no contradiction.\n\nJust as when one says, “The wood cooks,” it is not that the flames are not the instrument—rather, the flame is assumed.\n\nMoreover, as stated:\n“Yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau\ntasyai te kathitā hy arthāḥ prakāśante mahātmanaḥ**”\n— “Only to one who has supreme devotion to the Lord and equally to the guru do the truths of the scriptures become revealed.”\n\nAnd also:\n“At the moment of death, the Lord, who is the Supreme Brahman, reveals Himself; He is attained by that person. Therefore, He is attained.”\n\nSuch statements from the Śruti, Smṛti, and Purāṇas all remain harmonious only when bhakti is accepted as the cause of liberation.\nThus, it is proven: Bhakti alone is the cause of liberation.\n\nTherefore, by that very understanding given by Him, this commentary on the Gītā has been composed.\nMay that Mādhava, the Supreme Bliss, be pleased by it. ||१||\n\nThis Subodhinī commentary has now been made by Śrīdhara Svāmī, the ascetic who bears the dust of the lotus feet of the Lord of Supreme Bliss. ||२||\n\nEven if one repeatedly churns the Bhagavad Gītā using the force of their own cleverness to understand its essential meaning,\nhow will one attain the nectar of truth without the grace-filled glance of the guru?\n\nJust as a person cannot reach the jewels lying at the bottom of the ocean by scooping out the water with cupped hands—\ndoes anyone dive into the ocean without a proper boat and expert captain?\n\nLikewise, to know the ultimate truths of the Bhagavad Gītā, one must approach a true guru with surrender and humility, and only then will those truths be revealed.",
